## Overview

This repository provides the source code of an advanced `tryCatch` function for the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/) called `tryCatchLog`.

The main advantages of the `tryCatchLog` function over `tryCatch` are:

* **Easy logging** of errors, warnings and messages into a file or console
* **Complete stack trace with references to the source file names and line numbers**
  to identify the source of errors and warnings
  (R's `traceback` does not contain the full stack trace if you catch errors and warnings!)
* **[Post-mortem analysis](#post-mortem-analysis) or R errors by creating a dump file**
  with all variables of the global environment (workspace) and the function call stack (`dump.frames`)
  to enable the analysis of "crashed" batch jobs that you cannot debug on the server directly to reproduce the error!
* **Logging** of warnings (and other non-error conditions)
  **without stopping the execution** of the evaluated expression
  (unlike `tryCatch` does if you pass a warning handler function)
