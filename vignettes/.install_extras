# WORKAROUND:
# When R CMD build builds the vignettes,
# it copies these and the vignette sources from directory vignettes to inst/doc.
# To install any other files from the vignettes directory,
# this file specifies these as Perl-like regular expressions on one or more lines (see ?regexp).
# See: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Writing-package-vignettes
